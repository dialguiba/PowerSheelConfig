- **Install/Update Powershell**

  First of all, I recommend you install the last version of powershell. You can download it from here. Remember that this version is going to replace the powershell 6 if you have installed it. (Does not affect powershell version 5)

- **Install Windows Terminal (Optional)**

  If you want to personalize your terminal even more you can install Windows Terminal. You can download it from the microsoft store.
